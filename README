INTRO
Juxtaposer looks for NGS reads that may have resulted from genomic recombination, and tests them for the
 possibility of being: circles/scars from mobile elements, transpositions of transposons, or a palindrome artifact.

INPUT DIRECTORIES AND FILES
ngsdir: Directory containing a single fastq file qf.fq of read sequences, and where Juxtaposer outputs are written.
 We recommend using a different ngsdir directory for each experimental sample.
refdir: Directory containing information about the reference genome, to which Juxtaposer will write some files.
refPfx: refDir/prefix, where prefix is the part of the reference genome file preceding the .fa suffix
refPfx.fa: Multi-fasta file with all replicons (dnas) in the genome
[refPfx.tn.bed]: Recommended but optional transposon annotation file. Precise coordinates of genome's
 transposons/ISs, used to annotate reads from potential transposition junctions. An initial run of Juxtaposer may
 help discover circularizing transposons to add to this list. The user can also add other mobile elements, such as
 genomic islands, self-splicing introns, integron cassettes, etc., that may generate circular DNAs or deletion scars.
 Format, tab-delimited columns: [1] replicon; [2] left coordinate minus one; [3] right coordinate; [4] element
  name; [5] 1 if transposable, otherwise 0; [6] orientation (+ or -)

PREPARING READS
Juxtaposer requires an input file qf.fq, that contains NGS data from which low quality terminal regions and library
 primer sequences have been trimmed. Primer trimming allows the standard-read filter's global search to correctly
 identify standard genomic reads. We supply the quality filter qfilter.pl that we use. To use qfilter.pl properly,
 you must supply it the primer sequences used for library preparation. Qfilter.pl reads a file called primers.txt,
 that already contains some commonly used primer sets. To see those:
 $ qfilter.pl -primersets_available
 If your library used a primer set already in primers.txt simply supply that primerset name with the -primers
 option. If your library used different primers, you can write the set into the primers.txt file, or specify them
 directly with the -primers option.
We have been using SE reads, but if you have PE reads, we recommend the following: merge pairs using a tool like
 bbduk or PEAR, aiming to remove primer sequences and low quality regions, and combine all merged read pairs and
 unmerged reads into the qf.fq input file.
